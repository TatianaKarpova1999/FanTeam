          <h2>What Are Fantasy Sports?</h2>
          <p>
            Fantasy sports are online games where you create a team of real-life
            players. Based on their real-life performances, you earn points, and
            the better your team performs, the higher your rank. It's all about
            strategy, knowledge, and skill in choosing the right players. With
            FanTeam, you can compete in multiple sports like football,
            basketball, and cricket.
