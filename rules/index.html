          <h3>1. Game Basics</h3>
          <p>
            In FanTeam, you build your own team of real-life athletes across a
            range of sports. Your team's performance in various competitions is
            based on the actual performance of the athletes in real-world games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players earn points for your team based on their real-life
            statistics such as goals, assists, passes, etc. The better the
            athletes perform in their respective games, the more points your
            team earns. The ultimate goal is to have the best-performing team
            and win exciting rewards!

          <h3>2. Selecting Your Players</h3>
          <p>
            You can select players from a wide variety of sports including
            football, basketball, cricket, and more. The platform offers
            detailed statistics for each player, helping you make informed
            decisions about who to pick for your team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember: The key to success in fantasy sports is strategy. Consider
            player form, team schedules, injuries, and other factors when making
            your selections.

          <h3>3. Scoring System</h3>
          <p>
            Points are awarded based on the real-world performances of the
            players in your team. Here’s a basic overview of how scoring works:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Goals scored: +10 points</li>
            <li>Assists: +5 points</li>
            <li>Yellow card: -2 points</li>
            <li>Red card: -5 points</li>
            <li>Player of the match: +15 points</li>
            <li>Minutes played: +1 point for every 10 minutes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The full scoring system is available on the platform, and it may
            vary slightly depending on the specific fantasy league or tournament
            you join.
