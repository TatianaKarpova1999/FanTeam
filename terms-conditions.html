        <h2>Important Information</h2>
        <p>
          Participation in fantasy sports is subject to the laws of India. These
          games are considered a "game of skill" under Indian legislation and
          are permitted in most states. However, individuals residing in Andhra
          Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, and Telangana are not
          allowed to participate due to local regulations. To use this platform,
          users must be at least 18 years old. We encourage responsible play and
          advise you to ensure that you comply with all relevant legal
          requirements before getting involved.
