          <h3>Step 2: Understanding Fantasy Sports</h3>
          <p>
            Fantasy sports are about creating a team of real-life athletes from
            your chosen sport. You earn points based on their actual performance
            in real-world games. The better your players perform, the higher
            your score!
          </p>
          <p>
            In FanTeam, you can choose athletes from various sports such as
            football, basketball, and cricket. Each sport has its own set of
            scoring rules, so make sure to familiarize yourself with them to
            maximize your team's performance.

          <h3>Step 3: Build Your Dream Team</h3>
          <p>
            Now, it's time to build your fantasy team! Select players from your
            favorite sport and build a team that you believe will perform well
            based on their stats, current form, and upcoming fixtures.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Focus on player form: A player's current form is crucial for
              scoring well in fantasy sports.
            </li>
            <li>
              Analyze matchups: Check the upcoming fixtures and choose players
              with favorable matchups.
            </li>
            <li>
              Balance star players with potential hidden gems: Sometimes,
              lesser-known players can provide great value!
