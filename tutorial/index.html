        <h3>Step 2: Understanding Fantasy Sports</h3>
        <p>
          Fantasy sports are about creating a team of real-life athletes from
          your chosen sport. You earn points based on their actual performance
          in real-world games. The better your players perform, the higher your
          score!

        <p>
          In FanTeam, you can choose athletes from various sports such as
          football, basketball, and cricket. Each sport has its own set of
          scoring rules, so make sure to familiarize yourself with them to
          maximize your team's performance.
